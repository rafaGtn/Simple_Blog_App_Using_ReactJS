# 📝 Project Defense Cheat Sheet

## ✅ Checklist Before Demonstration

- [ ] Run `npm install`
- [ ] Run `npm run dev`
- [ ] Test all pages (Home, Post, About)
- [ ] Test like functionality
- [ ] Test comments functionality
- [ ] Test navigation between pages

---

## 🎯 What to Demonstrate

### 1. **Project Structure** (2 min)

Show folder structure:

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable components
├── Pages/          # Page components
├── redux/          # Redux for likes
└── store/          # Redux store
```

**Say**: "One component per file, clean separation of concerns"

---

### 2. **Home Page** (2 min)

- Show list of posts
- Click on a post to navigate
- **Say**: "React Router for navigation without page reload"

---

### 3. **Like Functionality with Redux** (5 min)

**This is your key feature!**

1. Click ❤️ on a post
2. Show the count increases
3. Navigate to post details
4. Show like persists
5. Navigate back to home
6. Like is still there!

**Explain**:

- "Likes managed with Redux Toolkit"
- "State persists across navigation"
- "useSelector reads state, useDispatch sends actions"

**Show code**:

- `src/redux/slices/postsSlice.js` - slice definition
- `src/store/store.js` - store setup
- `src/components/AppPost/AppPost.jsx` - useSelector & useDispatch

---

### 4. **Comments with useState** (3 min)

1. Go to any post
2. Add a comment
3. Show it appears

**Explain**:

- "Comments use local state (useState)"
- "No need for global state since comments are page-specific"
- "Shows understanding of when to use Redux vs useState"

---

### 5. **Routing** (2 min)

- Click between Home, About, Post pages
- Show URL changes
- No page reload

**Say**: "React Router DOM for SPA navigation"

---

## 💡 Key Points to Mention

### ✅ React Best Practices

- ✅ One component per file
- ✅ Props for passing data
- ✅ useState for local state (comments)
- ✅ useEffect for side effects (if asked)
- ✅ Semantic HTML (not just divs)

### ✅ Redux Implementation

- ✅ Redux Toolkit (modern approach)
- ✅ Simple & focused (only likes)
- ✅ Shows when to use global vs local state

### ✅ Functionality

- ✅ Add comments ✓
- ✅ Like posts ✓
- ✅ Navigation without reload ✓

---

## 🤔 Expected Questions & Answers

### Q: Why did you use Redux for likes but useState for comments?

**A**: "Likes need to persist when navigating between pages, so Redux provides a global state. Comments are only shown on the post page, so local useState is sufficient and simpler. This shows understanding of when to use each approach."

---

### Q: What is Redux Toolkit?

**A**: "Redux Toolkit is the modern, recommended way to use Redux. It simplifies setup with `configureStore`, combines reducers and actions with `createSlice`, and includes Immer for immutable updates automatically."

---

### Q: Explain your Redux data flow

**A**:

1. User clicks like button
2. Component dispatches `toggleLike(postId)` action
3. Redux reducer updates state: `likesByPost[postId] = true`
4. useSelector detects change
5. Component re-renders with new data

---

### Q: What's the difference between props and state?

**A**:

- **Props**: Data passed from parent to child, read-only
- **State**: Data managed within component, can be updated
- In this project: Post data passed as props, comments stored in state

---

### Q: Why React Router?

**A**: "React Router enables SPA (Single Page Application) navigation - URLs change without full page reloads, providing better user experience and faster navigation."

---

### Q: Could you use Context API instead of Redux?

**A**: "Yes, Context API could work for simple global state. I chose Redux Toolkit to demonstrate professional state management skills and because it's commonly used in production applications."
